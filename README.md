## RouteStyle

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2.

>Used to limit unused packages in the home page Previously all the required packages were downloaded during the site request and the pages are loaded to the user may not enter it and do not use and imagine how much of this data is used, and therefore the site does not work in the conditions of weak Internet, so in the use of "Lazy Loading" solved the number of problems in large sites , Dynamically better.
